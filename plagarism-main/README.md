### **Why Use Plagiarism Checker?**

It is a **free** alternative for plagiarism detection, ideal if you don’t have access to Turnitin or other paid tools. Quickly upload your content, check for potential matches, and generate a PDF report of the results. Whether you're a student ensuring originality or an educator verifying content integrity, it provides an easy-to-use platform.


### **How It Works:**

1. **Upload Your Document**: Supports **.txt, .doc, .docx, and .pdf.**
2. **Check for Plagiarism**: Click the **"Check Plagiarism"** button to start analyzing your content.
3. **Review Results**: Highlighted matches will be displayed based on the level of similarity.
4. **Generate a PDF Report**: Download a detailed report of your results.

### **AI Detection (ZipPy)**

The AI detector now uses **thinkst/zippy** (compression-based AI detection) as the single backend detector.

- Repo used: `https://github.com/thinkst/zippy.git`
- Ensemble engines: `lzma`, `brotli`, `zlib`
- API remains compatible with existing frontend fields like `aiProbability`

Backend environment variables:

- `AI_LOCAL_MODEL_ENABLED` (optional, default: `true`) - keep as `false` to disable AI detection.
- `AI_MODEL_PYTHON_BIN` (optional, default: `python`)
- `ZIPPY_REPO_PATH` (optional) - explicit path to your cloned `zippy` repo.
- `ZIPPY_PRELUDE_FILE` (optional) - custom prelude file path.
- `ZIPPY_PRESET` (optional) - compressor preset override.
- `ZIPPY_SIGMOID_SCALE` (optional, default: `6.0`) - score-to-probability calibration.
